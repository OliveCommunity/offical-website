# Olive Video Editor Community Edition

## Introduction

Olive is an open-source video editor originally created by the [Olive Team](https://github.com/olive-editor). Unfortunately, the original author has not submitted code updates for  over 9 months, and no public contact information (email or otherwise) is available to reach them directly.

We need a free software video editor (ensuring users retain the right to control their device, not just zero cost - see [GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html)) that works reliably on GNU/Linux. For too long, GNU/Linux users have  faced limited options for professional video editing. While solutions  like DaVinci Resolve offer GNU/Linux versions, they often present  compatibility issues and lack full feature parity (such as inconsistent  H.265 support) compared to other platforms.

We are taking action to change this situation. GNU/Linux  users shouldn't need to compromise on their right to control their  devices simply to access capable video editing software. Together, we  can make this change.

**Join our community effort!**

## Current Status

Now I am working on the plugin branch and I'm adding OpenFX plugin support to this project.
